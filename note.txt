I am so sad. All the time. And I feel like the problem of beating myself up is worse than ever before. I am tired a lot. I am scared to death of what my future holds. I feel like I'm floating in an ever flowing limbo of sadness, one where I can't seem to decide wether I should keep going or not.

And I am so MAD. SO FUCKING MAD. I just want to be happy. I don't know why landing a job is so fucking hard. I don't know why I am just such a screw up. I hate all of this so much right now. I'm trying my fucking absolute hardest to stay positive.

I just don't know what to do anymore. 

I just want to not have the stresses of life weighing on me all day anymore. I want to be happy. But I'm not.
